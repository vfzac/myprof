# Hello and Welcome! 
## This is Fritz Valzado's profile


### First I should list my specializations(or atleast what I want mine to be)
#### 1: Photo Editing  
The goal is to make composite images closer to professional a professional level.  
I'm at the level of cheap image filters.
Here's one semi-decent enhancement I did.

#### 2: Video Editing
I wanted to work in VFX but I don't think I can be good enough if I'm not focusing on that one thing
